    <h3> 
      Keep in mind the following:
    </h3> 
    <ul> 
      <li> 
        The topic of a talk can come from a truly broad spectrum.
      </li> 
      <li> 
        Any interesting theme from java is welcome, from surveys to experience reports or specialized research topics.
      </li> 
      <li> 
        However, one should keep in mind that a talks can be expected to attract a reasonable number of participants (80-500 participants).
      </li> 
      <li> 
        This is most likely the case if the topic is new or relevant to a broad community.
      </li> 
      <li> 
        Experience has shown that talks on a very basic level especially introductions to mainstream techniques and products oriented presetantins are out.
      </li> 
      <li> 
        Surveys, lessons learned and advanced topics (including advanced topics on programming technics) are often much more successful.
      </li> 
      <li> 
        JavaZone participants are usually quite experienced in java and OOA, OOD, OOP and come to a talk in order to get insight into some new area.
      </li> 
      <li> 
        The earlier a proposal arrives, the better the chances to get feedback in order to bring the proposal into a form that is likely to be accepted.
      </li> 
      <li> 
        For additional questions or clarification, or for your suggestions, please feel free to contact the programme comittee.
      </li> 
    </ul> 
    <p> 
      If you think that you are highly experienced in a certain area of java technology and that others could benefit from sharing this experience with you, you should submit a proposal.

    <h3> 
      Tips on Slides and notes
    </h3> 
    <ul> 
      <li> 
        The slide deck must be submitted by August 18.th.
      </li> 
      <li> 
        Here are a few guidelines for preparing the slides
      </li> 
      <li> 
        Use at least a 14&nbsp;pt (or better an 18&nbsp;pt) font on all of your slides.
      </li> 
      <li> 
        A good slide should not just repeat everything you say but summarize your presentation.
      </li> 
      <li> 
        Use short phrases and keywords instead of full sentences.
      </li> 
      <li> 
        People cannot read as fast as you speak. Make heavy use of pictures and examples.
      </li> 
      <li> 
        Don&#39;t put too much or too little material on a single slide.
      </li> 
      <li> 
        A good rule of thumb is to spend 3 minutes per slide.
      </li> 
      <li> 
        You will have to deliver the session slides (see the deadline below).
      </li> 
      <li> 
        Try to achieve good printing quality.
      </li> 
      <li /> 
      <li> 
        We might add an uniform cover page to all tutorial notes.
      </li> 
    </ul> 
    <br /> 
     <br /> 
     
    <h3> 
      Tips on Presentation:
    </h3> 
    <ul> 
      <li> 
        The participants expect that your presentation will be much easier to understand than a book about the same subject.
      </li> 
      <li> 
        Thus speak clearly and lively. Try to interact with your audience. (Remember that Norwegian participants need a longer warm-up time than an american audience)
      </li> 
      <li> 
        A presentation is much more lively if it also includes examples and demonstrations
      </li> 
      <li> 
        After the session the participants will be asked to assess the talk with a questionnaire.
      </li> 
    </ul> 
     <br />
