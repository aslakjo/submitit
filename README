We are currently developing a Scala-Lift application called SubmitIT, see (fredriv/submitit). Awesome learning Lift. We are kind of in a hurry for a deadline, hence we have prepared an version in wicket.

Hopefully we will be able to use the Lift app, but if not, this is the fallback.

This is Wicket with Scala. Awesome combination! :)
